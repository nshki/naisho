# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

        Dear {COMPANY NAME},


        I am writing to formally request the deletion of my personally identifiable information as per my rights under the %{regulation_name} (%{regulation_code}, %{region}). I am a resident and, as such, I am entitled to request the deletion of my personal data that you may have collected, processed, or sold.


        Please find below the details necessary to identify and locate my information in your database:


        • Full Name: [YOUR FULL NAME]

        • Address: [YOUR FULL ADDRESS]

        • Email Address(es): [YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS(ES)]

        • Phone Number(s): [YOUR PHONE NUMBER(S)]

        • Any other relevant information you may have associated with my profile


        Under the %{regulation_code}, the above information can only be used for verification purposes and you may not collect it.


        I kindly request that you promptly delete all of my personal information from your records and confirm in writing once this has been completed. Please also provide details on the steps taken to ensure that my data has been permanently removed from your systems and any third parties with whom you may have shared it.


        I expect full compliance with this request within the time frame stipulated by %{region} law. Failure to do so may result in further action being taken to protect my privacy rights.


        Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving confirmation of the deletion of my personal information.


        Sincerely,

        [YOUR SIGNATURE NAME]

        questions:
          - question: "What are data brokers?"
            answer: "Data brokers are companies that collect, analyze, and sell personal information about individuals to other companies, often without their knowledge or consent."
          - question: "How does this service source data brokers?"
            answer: "Naisho uses the data broker list from the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) as well as DataBrokersWatch.org."
          - question: "How can I trust this service?"
            answer: "Naisho is completely open-source. The site you are using right now is operated by the same code you can find on our GitHub repository."
          - question: "Can I run this service myself? Can I self-host this?"
            answer: "Yes and yes! You can find the source code and instructions on running the app locally or self-hosting on GitHub."
          - question: "The email template has placeholders for personal information. What if I don't want to give that out?"
            answer: "The email template includes language to explicitly prohibit the collection of included personal information, but you are free to edit the email as you see fit."
          - question: "What if I don't get a response from a data broker?"
            answer: "Unfortunately, it's up to the data broker to comply with your request. If you don't hear back, you can follow up with them directly or file a complaint with your region's relevant government body."
          - question: "I want to help. How can I contribute?"
            answer: "Naisho is open-source and contributions are welcome. You can find the source code and join the discussion on GitHub."
